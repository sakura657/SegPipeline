# Data files
# --- Specific to your project ---
# Raw Data (adjust path if it's outside SegPipeline folder)
# Example if raw data is sibling to SegPipeline: ../uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation/
# Example if raw data is inside SegPipeline (less common): uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation/
# Add the correct relative path from .gitignore location to your raw data folder
# ../uw-madison-gi-tract-image-segmentation/  <-- ADJUST THIS PATH!

# *.nii.gz # Be careful if you have NIfTI files you *do* want to track
